# Express-Routing-Challenge

This is practice for using Express. The app takes a song title and artist, adds it to a list, and appends it on the DOM.

It also checks to see if the song has already been submitted, and if it has, throws an error.

## Future Updates

In the future, I plan on styling the app.

I also plan on adding a remove button to the lines that are appended so songs can be removed.
